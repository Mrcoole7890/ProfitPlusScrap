# Profit Plus Webscraper Proto

# Context

Yesterday, me and Harrison discussd how we wanted to make another attempt at creating a webscraper for getting the clearance deals from Home Depot and Lowes. As I am looking to fill my LinkedIn with proofs of work to highlight my skills, I am going to use this public repo to store my work. The desired end product should look something like what is listed in this video.

Harrison has stated that this is our competitors product. I want to first make the backend so that the results can be published where ever so long as the backend is working as expected.

# Objective

To implement a web scraper that pulls items on clearance and stores them on a database to be queried by front end requests.

# Execution Notes
